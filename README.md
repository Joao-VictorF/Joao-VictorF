# Hi there, I'm João (It's like "John") 🤟🏼👨🏻‍💻

#### I am 18 years old , I study and work with software development since I was 15 years old 👶🏻 and since then I fell in love 🥰 with the technology area and I have been dedicating myself to the maximum to always be the best version of me!


- 💻 I am currently working with Vue.js, Flutter, React Native, Coordinating projects and with UI Design!! Yeah, I'm pretty flexible!

- 🌱 I am currently learning UX, going deeper into Javascript and Flutter and studying (out of curiosity, so far) Artificial Intelligence, mainly Genetic Algorithms..

- 📫 How to talk to me: just send an email to freitasjoaovictor49@gmail.com and I will respond immediately! (at least I'll try hahah) 😄

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am self-taught and always liked to learn new things.
I started learning English (I'm Brazilian) playing pokemon as a child (ok, I confess, I used pirated versions in emulators! 😅😅), watching movies and series, and using Duolingo!
